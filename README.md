# my-trips

This is my first iOS app made with Swift and one of my first standalone programming projects.

This app can calculate a route given a start and end location and store that route on an iOS device. Once routes are stored, they can be viewed, deleted, or exported as a .csv file. The app also allows for users to insert a trip if they forget to use the app during their trip.

Works for driven routes only. Compatible with iOS dark mode. 

I used the LocationPicker API by almassapargali on GitHub for the insertion of trips, everything else was built using the built-in swift framework.
